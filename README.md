# parce

This is a parsing and lexing library written in C.

- To compile the project, run `make` or `make all`.
- To run the tests, run `make test`.
- To clean the out directories, run `make clean`.

TODO:
- Write the `char *` -> `regex_t` routine for the lexer.
- Write more comprehensive tests for the lexer.
- Gather tests into one executable for running or use `Check` for unit tests.
- Write the `char *` -> `Rule` _(future struct)_ routine for the parser.
- Write more comprehensive tests for the parser.
